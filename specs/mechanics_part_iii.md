# Game Mechanics Part III - Rewards


## Leaderboard Rewards

Both incentive approaches (see part IIa and IIb) give each user a score tied to each genre (credit points for that specific genre). This results in an overall leaderboard per genre displaying the highest ranking users. To incentivize the community of doing the work, the highest ranking users will unlock special permissions or achievements.

The leaderboards could be updated once every 24 hours or in real-time.



**Possible User Rewards:**
* Able to create a new genre
>_Challenger high_
* Able to vote to change one or several governance parameters
>_Defender mid - Top 20 after minimum genre score of X_
* Able to change certain part of the artwork: add a picture or banner
>_Defender high - Top 10_
* Able to create public custom playlists
>_Defender low_
* Your personal heatmap (user data) and avatar become bumped to higher tier
>_Challenger low_
* Able to edit wiki
>_Challenger mid_
* Able to vote on the super-genre labels
>_Challenger mid_
* Able to vote on relationship links concerning the genre
>_Defender mid_



## End-2-End Scenario (based on IIb)

Alice opens the user interface of a specific genre (e.g. Psychobilly) and sees all currently listed Psychobilly songs. The songs are ranked automatically by their score which is determined by the total amount of users vouching for that song.  
Alice can search for any keyword, filter the playlist by artist, title, album, or year or just scroll and swipe through it casually.  
While browsing the playlist, she might notice that a certain song does not belong there, i.e. it is not Psychobilly. Alice can then press the “reject” button next to the song and confirm her choice. Now, whenever another user also agrees with Alice and votes reject, that vote will count as one credit point towards Alice’s score. So Alice stakes her belief that a song is incorrect. The more users agree, not only the higher Alice’s score will be (which in turn will grant her rewards) but also the lower the song will be ranked, until the point of complete removal from the playlist.  
On the other hand, Alice can also help curate the ranking by voting “vouch” for the songs that are definitely Psychobilly. Whenever another user also votes “vouch” for the same song, Alice will gain one credit point.  
The mechanics go like this: Alice will vote for whatever song she thinks will attract the most users. These will be the most well-known, quintessential songs of the genre, and therefore automatically will appear at the top based on their score. But Alice will also vote on lesser-known songs as these will have a lot more potential to gather votes than songs where almost the entire community has already cast their vote.  
Obtaining a high user score thanks to lots of good (or lucky) vouching will yield Alice rewards (albeit different ones to incentivize practicing both votes).  
Of course, Alice can cheat by blindly spamming vouch to gain a high score or reject to troll the list. But the game mechanics will punish such behaviour while also limiting the amount of votes per day.


## From Web 2.5 to Web 3.0

After mass adoption, the sidechain can be changed to a main net and user credits can be swapped for real tokens. Each credit point equals one token. This will change the incentive mechanics completely, because now users will have a financial motivation. This requires further investigation later.
